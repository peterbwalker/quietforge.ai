### Agentic AI for Mortgage Automation

Quiet Forge Technologies builds **agentic AI systems** that automate complex, high-friction workflows in the mortgage industry. We focus on **end-to-end automation across heterogeneous inputs and outputs**, enabling intelligent orchestration across voice, text, and structured data.

Our mission is to move beyond brittle RPA and narrow chatbots toward **autonomous, goal-directed agents** that can reason, act, and adapt across the full mortgage lifecycle.

## 🚀 What We Build

We develop AI-driven automation platforms purpose-built for mortgage lenders, servicers, and call centers, leveraging modern **agentic model architectures**.

### Core Capabilities

- **🔊 Multimodal Automation**
  - Voice → Text (ASR)
  - Text → Voice (TTS)
  - Voice → Voice (fully automated conversational workflows)

- **🔁 Heterogeneous I/O Pipelines**
  - Seamless integration across calls, documents, chat, email, and structured loan data

- **🤖 Agentic Orchestration**
  - Autonomous agents that plan, route, and execute multi-step workflows
  - Human-in-the-loop escalation where required

- **🏦 Mortgage-Focused Automation**
  - Call center and borrower support automation
  - Intake, follow-ups, and loan status checks
  - Document requests and servicing workflows
  - Compliance-aware task execution

> Unlike traditional automation, our systems are designed to **understand intent**, **coordinate actions**, and **optimize outcomes** — not just follow scripts.

## 🧩 Why Agentic AI

Mortgage operations are inherently **multivariate, asynchronous, and fragmented**.  
Agentic models allow us to:

- Reason across multiple data sources and modalities  
- Maintain context across long-running interactions  
- Autonomously complete tasks instead of simply responding  
- Reduce operational cost while improving borrower experience  

This represents a shift from automation as tooling to automation as **decision-making infrastructure**.
